# Hue
Phillips Hue module for the ZWay home automation system

This is a modificaiton of Minux's original module.

Original discussion thread here: https://forum.z-wave.me/viewtopic.php?f=3419&t=24012

Mostly adapted to work with Hue Ambience lights and to make the refresh more efficient.

Ambience lights work, everything else is untested.

Refresh of scenes and full refresh of RGB values need work.
